          <p>
            A Crisis Pregnancy Center (CPC), sometimes called a Pregnancy
            Resource Center, is a fake clinic that does <em>NOT</em> provide
            comprehensive reproductive health care â€” or much of any health care
            at all.

              They are anti-abortion counseling centers with an
              agenda. They use advertisements to trick pregnant people into making
              an appointment, promising free ultrasounds or free pregnancy tests
              with the goal of pressuring people to carry a pregnancy to term.
              Generally they do not use the ultrasound as a diagnostic tool, but
              as another means of shame and coercion.

              Their goal is to dissuade individuals from exercising their right to
              choose. Many CPCs intentionally misinform and mislead those seeking
              pregnancy-related information. Once inside, people are lied to,
              shamed, and pressured about their reproductive health decisions,
              often delaying and increasing the cost of their procedure or pushing
              them past a deadline for legal abortion altogether. CPCs often look
              like medical facilities, yet they do not practice medicine.

              These practices block any pregnant person from making fully
              informed choices about their reproductive health and put them in
              danger by delaying access to legitimate health-care services.
