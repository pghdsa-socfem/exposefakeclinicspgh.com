          <h3>The <span class="pop">Tactics</span></h3>
          <ul class="facts">
						<li>
              <strong>Deception</strong>: CPCs pose as women's health clinics or
              medical facilities but often provide biased pregnancy counseling.
              Some use debunked studies correlating abortions to cancer and
              depression. CPCs often lie to patients once they're inside. They
              have been known to ask probing and invasive questions, and
              manipulate so-called <q>abortion minded</q> individuals about
              their spirituality and relationships.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>False Advertisement</strong>: CPCs advertise to target
              pregnant people who may be seeking abortion care. They often
              position themselves near real, medically-licensed health care
              providers.  Many CPCs do not follow HIPAA regulations (because
              HIPAA only applies to actual medical providers).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Stalling</strong>: Some will delay and cancel
              appointments, hoping to push people past the legal limit for
              abortion. By scheduling appointments at a location where they
              cannot receive complete reproductive health care, patients can
              waste weeks of time, making eventual procedures more expensive or
              inaccessible due to state law. The farther along a pregnancy goes,
              the more expensive the procedure. They seek to whittle away at a
              person's options and make accessing an abortion that much harder.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Intimidation</strong>: Some CPCs work with protesters to
              intimidate people going into abortion provider offices. Many CPCs
              share patient data, and try to intimidate legit providers.
